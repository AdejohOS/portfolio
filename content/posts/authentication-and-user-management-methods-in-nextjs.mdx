Authentication and user management are critical components of any modern web
application, including those built with **Next.js**. They ensure security,
enable personalized user experiences, and allow developers to manage user access
efficiently.

## **Introduction**

Next.js is a **React-based framework** designed to enhance web development by
simplifying the creation of fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.
Developed by **Vercel**, Next.js has become a popular choice for building modern
web applications due to its rich features which includes Server Side Rendering
(SSR), Static generation (SSG), ApI Routes, Automatic Code Splitting etc.

Authentication and user management are critical components of any modern web
application, including those built with **Next.js**. They ensure security,
enable personalized user experiences, and allow developers to manage user access
efficiently.

Almost all web or mobile application today would require some authentication and
verification of its users which would consequently grant access to part or whole
of the application.

### **Authentication**

In Next.js, authentication typically involves managing user sessions and
securely handling authentication tokens or credentials. There are different
approaches depending on whether you are using **client-side** or **server-side**
authentication. Here's a breakdown of how authentication works in Next.js:

#### **1\. Authentication in Client-side Rendering (CSR)**

In a client-side rendered (CSR) application, the entire application is loaded
into the browser, and interactions with the server are done through API routes
or other AJAX calls. Authentication in CSR often involves managing an
authentication token (e.g., a JWT) in the client-side storage (like cookies,
localStorage, or sessionStorage) and sending that token with each request to
verify the user's identity.

**Flow**:

1. **Login**: The user submits their credentials via a form.
2. **Backend Validation**: The credentials are validated against a backend
   service (e.g., a database, OAuth provider).
3. **Token Generation**: If the credentials are valid, a token (such as JWT) is
   generated.
4. **Storing the Token**: The token is stored on the client (usually in cookies
   or sessionStorage).
5. **Authenticated Requests**: For subsequent requests, the client sends the
   token in the HTTP headers, often using `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

**Security Considerations**:

- Tokens should be stored securely to prevent XSS or CSRF attacks. It's often
  recommended to use **HttpOnly cookies** for storing tokens in CSR.
- Client-side authentication alone does not always ensure security; server-side
  validation is crucial for sensitive operations.

#### **2\. Authentication in Server-side Rendering (SSR)**

Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR), where content is rendered on the
server before being sent to the client. This can improve performance and SEO,
and also provides a more secure way to handle authentication because user
credentials and session data can be validated on the server, preventing some
client-side vulnerabilities.

**Flow**:

1. **Login**: The user submits their credentials (e.g., email and password) via
   a form.
2. **Server-side Validation**: On the server, Next.js API routes (or another
   server-side function) validate the user's credentials.
3. **Session Creation**: Once authenticated, a session is created. In most
   cases, this involves generating a session token or setting an authentication
   cookie.
4. **Session Validation**: On each request, Next.js checks if the user has a
   valid session using the session cookie. This can be done in
   `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps`, or API routes.
5. **Access Control**: If the session is valid, the user can access protected
   pages. If not, they are redirected to the login page.

**Server-side Authentication Libraries**:

- **NextAuth.js**: A popular authentication library for Next.js that simplifies
  SSR authentication by integrating with providers like Google, GitHub, and
  email-based login.
- **JWT + API Routes**: You can implement JWT-based authentication with Next.js
  API routes to handle both login and session management.

#### **3\. Static Site Generation (SSG) with Authentication**

Next.js can also generate static sites (SSG), which involve building pages at
build time. While authentication for static pages is less common, there are use
cases where authentication is needed before content is generated (for instance,
in a private blog or member-only content).

**Flow**:

- **Pre-build Authentication**: You can use API routes or authentication logic
  during build time to pre-render content only for authenticated users.
- **Revalidation**: For dynamic or updated content, you can use Next.js’
  Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to revalidate content after it's
  initially built, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain
  pages.

#### **4\. Using API Routes for Authentication**

Next.js allows you to build API routes that can act as backend endpoints for
authentication-related actions, such as login, registration, and logout. These
routes can interact with a database or authentication provider.

**Flow**:

1. The frontend sends a request (e.g., `POST /api/login`) with the user’s
   credentials.
2. The API route validates the credentials, creates a session or generates a
   JWT, and returns the token or session ID.
3. The token is stored on the client (typically in cookies).
4. For subsequent requests, the client sends the token in the headers or as
   cookies for authentication.

#### **Common Authentication Patterns in Next.js**

- **OAuth Authentication**: Next.js can integrate with third-party OAuth
  providers like Google, Facebook, or GitHub, using libraries such as
  `NextAuth.js` to simplify the OAuth flow.
- **Session-based Authentication**: This approach typically involves setting an
  HTTP-only cookie that contains the session ID, allowing the server to identify
  the user across requests.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens are commonly used for stateless
  authentication, where the token contains user information and is stored
  client-side (often in cookies or localStorage).

By leveraging these techniques, Next.js provides flexibility for implementing
authentication across different types of applications, whether they're CSR, SSR,
or static sites. The choice between client-side or server-side authentication
depends on the level of security and user experience required for your project.

There are basically 3 three types of authentication.

- **Client-side authentication**: For SPAs and lightweight apps.
- **Server-side authentication**: For secure, dynamic applications.
- **Third-party authentication**: Using providers like Google, GitHub, etc.

In this post we will learn (3) three simple auth methods, their pros and cons
and which would be suitable for your Next.js project.

1. [Auth.js (NextAuth.js)](https://authjs.dev/)
2. [Clerk.js](https://clerk.com/)
3. [Kinde.js](https://kinde.com/)
